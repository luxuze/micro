Micro is a framework for cloud native development.

## Overview

Micro addresses the key requirements for building services in the cloud. It leverages the microservices
architecture pattern and provides a set of services which act as the building blocks of a platform. Micro deals
with the complexity of distributed systems and provides simpler programmable abstractions to build on.
